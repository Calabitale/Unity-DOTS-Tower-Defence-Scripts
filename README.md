All the scripts I made for a prototype Tower Defence in Unity DOTS 0.5(it wouldn't take much effort to update it for 1.0).  It features a basic state machine for the robot, DOTS physics, triggers, a flow field with basic avoidance.  UI elements used in DOTS, and plenty of other things.  All the ingredients you would likely need to make your own basic game in Unity DOTS.

# DOTS-Tower-Defence-Scripts

https://youtu.be/9BmBGkegQzE

All the scripts I made for a prototype Tower Defence in Unity DOTS 0.5(it wouldn't take much effort to update it for 1.0).  It features a basic state machine for the robot, DOTS physics, triggers, a flow field with basic avoidance.  UI elements used in DOTS.  All the ingredients you would likely need to make your own basic game in Unity DOTS.
